This will host the source code and information pertaining to my MSDS 498 Individual Project.

## Romeo and Juliet Text
Originally, the Romeo and Juliet text was downloaded from this website: **https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1513** <br /><br />
Since the text was uploaded to my local computer previously, I just had to select `Add file` and then `Upload file` within this repository to add the .txt to it.
